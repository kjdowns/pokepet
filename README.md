# PokePet

PokePet is a pet simulation web application that allows a user to adopt and care for PokePets. Once A user has signed up or signed in through Google, 
they will have access to a list of PokePets they can adopt. From there a user can feed, play with, and train their PokePets until they reach MAX level.

There are also many town areas, such as the PokeMart and PokeBank that users can explore with their PokePets.
